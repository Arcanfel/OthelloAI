Evaluation function.


The function prototype was changed, so that it can hold MoveLists for p1 and p2.
They are not changed by the way, just needed for some data.
Function consists of 2 if statements for 2 players. The basic logic is that
mobility of a player should be considered first + all the empty adjacent fields 
around opponents frotier pieces + possible corner moves for a player.


CreateTree(int board[][NUMSQUARES],int lvl) function is not changed as much as Eval.
The only difference is that I let it to build the tree as far left down as possible,
ant when recursive function gets up on the stack, on each level it compares existing 
node to a new possible node. If this new node is better, than previous node gets nulled
and new node is created.

This logic works for both players.

By the way, the tree height is 7.
